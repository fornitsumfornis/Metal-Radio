# Metal-Radio
Just a command line interface for an internet radio station.  The program is written in python but uses bash calls to stream the stations.
It's nothing fancy, but I wanted a command line way of accessing multiple metal stations without having to open a browser (I listen to music from a Raspberry Pi in my office.  So I wrote the code and voila, Metal Music Player!

##Dependencies
This depends on myplayer (sudo apt-get install myplayer -y), python (sudo apt-get install python3.5 -y), Pip (sudo apt-get install python-pip -y) and finally Colroama (pip install colorama).
